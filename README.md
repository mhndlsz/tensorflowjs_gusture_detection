# tensorflowjs_gusture_detection

The Four Golden steps:

1- import the library tensorflow.js
2- import the pre trained MobileNet model.
3- load the image element or webcam video elemnt.
4- feed the element to the model.
5- vola .... the model will predict

To make the classification customize:
1- we need to import KNN module to allow us change the MobileNet classifications.
2- we will add 3 (or any amounts of) custom classes to feed to KNN.
